        <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knitting is never easy at the starting line. I can swear that I once saw a guy knitted a pile of thread with a thread. As silly as it can be! But fear not, as a professional knitter who have 10 million subscribers on my YouTube channel, I proudly present Knit It, the book that collects every single pitch of knowledge I have learnt about knitting. With this book, we'll start from something easy like a coaster, and move on to scarf, sweater, socks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want it? You knit it! </p>
