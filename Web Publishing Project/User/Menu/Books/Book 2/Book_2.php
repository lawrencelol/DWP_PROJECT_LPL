        <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a good kid, I always hit the sack right after giving my Mon and Dad a goodnight kiss at 10p.m. However, I just can't sleep, not this night. There's something under my bed. I know it, I heard its claw scratching the floor, its tail swinging at the cover of the night, and the sound it makes. "Meow!" See! It makes the sound again. I will not close my eyes unless I figured what it is.</p>
