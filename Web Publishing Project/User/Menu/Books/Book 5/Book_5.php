        <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's someone else around me since I was a child. I never saw her, I just know her." Another sentence written in Laura's diary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be weird, but Laura's not lying, she can tell that there is another existence hovering around her when she's writing her diary, staring at her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it! Whoever you are, show yourself!" Laura screamed and the owner of the sight shows up. Not in the room, but the mirror in front of her. She freaks out and starts to throw anything she can reach to the mirror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy there young lady. I'm just your dead twin sister, bruh." said the girl inside the mirror.</p>
