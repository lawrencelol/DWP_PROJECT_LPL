        <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flippy is a silly little fish that got separated from his family due to a strong undercurrent. To reunite with his family, he embarked on a solo journey. Along the way, he encountered various ocean residents, including a shark who loves planting corals, an evil clownfish, and even a granny octopus who enjoys collecting seashells. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flippy's story will teach children not to judge others by their appearance and the importance to take the first step.</p>
